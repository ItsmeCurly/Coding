My implementation of Extra Credit #2 on homework #4. Contains some implementation of #3 EC but has no successful results.
Clocks will eventually fall behind due to computations but are always at the same time as eachother as they run off the same time object
Clocks can be reset by pressing Current Time on the Slider Clock. The digital clock's font was not changed to a suitable font, but rather just used
monospaced bold italics.
As follows from the coding homework(non extra credit), I still do not know if my implementation of the makefile is correct
