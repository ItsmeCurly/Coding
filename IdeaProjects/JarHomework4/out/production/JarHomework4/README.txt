This is my implementation of the coding section of homework 4 along with the extra credit portion tied to it.
The two JFrames, the input and the console/treestate frames, are separate frames, both tied to different classes.
The input is its own jpanel/jframe set with the main class, and the treestate/console jframe is a private class within the
Pane.java class.
Pane.java also has a JFrame appear upon incorrect input for error-checking. Clicking OK on the box will make it disappear
and allow the user to reenter information. The treestate will be constantly updated as items are added/deleted.
I'm also not too sure if my makefile is working, I'd like input on how to make one/if my previous ones were working, but I still haven't gotten back
homework 2, so I'm not too sure.
