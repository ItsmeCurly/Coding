This package of classes utilizes a K search tree and Record Manager and allows the user to interact with them through a GUI
The GUI is created using swing components, two frames in total. The tree state is constantly updated on the right textarea, while the command console
is updated on the left. The text output color/font changes from output and command.
I still have absolutely no idea how to make a makefile and whether, despite this one having all the correct notations, it is what is necessary for this class,
as it is so vague what exactly is needed.
