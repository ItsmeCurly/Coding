#COS226 KTrees
The K search tree, in class KSearchTree, is composed of a root and a k value. The root references its sibling in the 
chain of the trees, and also its child(the tree is implemented as a linked-list, as it works to allow the tree to be 
O(H).The RecordManager class is a pass-through class that allows for recreation of the KSearchTree from the ground 
up, and the main class is the runner class for the set of classes. In the main class there is a while loop that the 
user will input commands that will do what the user asks for, and handles some error checking in case of incorrect 
input.
