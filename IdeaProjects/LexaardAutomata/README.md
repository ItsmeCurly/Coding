Automaton.java - FSA with states and alphabet. Has an equals method to compare automata
State.java - Holds the state that is within the Automata
Interpreter.java - Runs the program and takes input from the user. Also handles the conversion of FSAs

This project is an extension of Lexaard from HW(2?). The program takes input from a user to construct variables,
such as Automata including DFA and NFA. The program allows the user to run a certain input string on an FSA as well.

This project has been debugged up to the last two functionalities, which were not able to be debugged due to time 
constraints.

Included are some of the input tests that I utilized to test my functionality of the program. Some extraneous debugging 
may have gone over my scope, causing errors at some random points, but I didn't have extensive time to spend on this 
project
