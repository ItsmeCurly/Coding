HW 6 \
In this implementation, PDA's are taken in as a string representation

The new class is PDA.java, which contains PDAState.java and Transition in PDAState.java. 
Other classes have been compressed to save space, and because I learned the usage of subclasses more intricately.
Most compressed classes aren't used, but Rules in CFG are put as a subclass as it seemed correct

The two algorithms, cfg2pda and pda2cfg are in PDA.java in static form, so you pass the certain PDA/CFG as methods
Included are the rest of the classes and some sample input, but the output is consistent with what the homework specified
