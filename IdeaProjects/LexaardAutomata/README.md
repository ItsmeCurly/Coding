HW 5

CFG stores data in an arraylist of rules, in which modifications are made to.
Rules have two variables, LHS and RHS that store the data of the rules, as per the format 
specified by the homework.

To create a cfg: "define x cfg\nname data rules", as specified by homework
To create chomskyNF: define c1NF chomskyNF c1, if c1 is a CFG. 
Creates a CFG in the chomskyNF format as a copy of c1, without overwriting c1.
to define a boolean specifying cfgGen: define b1 cfgGen c1 %string%

I'd like feedback in email form if possible regarding whether my makefiles are working or whether they need to be 
modified before it is too late to possibly resubmit with a correct makefile
