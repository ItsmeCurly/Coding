This project includes main.go as the sole source that is used in the project. This file contains variables openBrowser and openFromFile, which will determine whether you want to open the browser or not and whether you want to read from the html.html file or read directly from the html source I was utilizing (https://www.webscraper.io/test-sites/e-commerce/allinone), which is a web scraping test site.
Other variables for highlighting color of variables and background color are included, to change to your discretion. The html.html file can be changed to any html that is utilized to run, so much as the KEYWORD in the const section of the project is modified to search for a letter in the html. 
If the openBrowser is set to true, then it will open the default browser with the html file for easy error checking.
